# The Sparks Foundation Internship Tasks
This repository contains two tasks: one for linear regression analysis on student scores data, and another for decision tree classification on the Iris flower dataset.

## Assignment 1: Task 1 - Linear Regression on Student Scores
This task demonstrates the use of linear regression to predict student scores based on the number of hours studied. The dataset contains two columns: Hours and Scores. The steps include importing necessary libraries, reading the dataset, visualizing data, preprocessing, training the model, visualizing the best-fit line, making predictions, comparing actual and predicted results, and evaluating the model.

## Assignment 2: Task 6- Decision Tree Classification on Iris Dataset
This task demonstrates the use of a decision tree classifier to classify Iris flowers based on their sepal and petal dimensions. The dataset contains five columns: sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width, and iris_class. The steps include importing necessary libraries, loading the dataset, training the model, and visualizing the decision tree.
